Wife: Come my dear I'll show you my youth through these photographs
<br>
Daughter: Yes mother. I'm really curious about how you were around my age.
<br>
Wife: Here, this is my grandmother who influenced my youth so much that she became a part of me. Her “Ivyhouse” novel is my precious thing in the entire world. 
<br>
Daughter: Is that so mother, I’m really yearning to read that novel, well it I'll look for it.
